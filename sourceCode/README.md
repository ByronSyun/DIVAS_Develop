# DIVAS Source Code

This directory contains original development code, examples, and scripts that demonstrate the usage and capabilities of the DIVAS methodology.

## Directory Structure

- **examples/**: Example analysis scripts showing how to use DIVAS with different types of datasets
- **development/**: Experimental code and functions that may be incorporated into future versions
- **benchmarks/**: Code for performance benchmarking and comparison with other methods

## Usage

The scripts in this directory are provided for educational and reference purposes. For standard analysis using DIVAS, we recommend using the stable functions provided in the main R package.

Example usage:
```R
# Example of running a DIVAS analysis on the toy dataset
source("examples/toy_data_analysis.R")
```

## Contributing

If you develop useful scripts or examples that demonstrate new applications of DIVAS, please consider contributing them to this directory by:

1. Creating a well-documented R script
2. Adding appropriate comments and function documentation
3. Including example data or clear instructions on obtaining required data
4. Submitting a pull request with your contribution

## Notes

- Scripts in this directory may depend on specific package versions or additional dependencies
- Some scripts may be exploratory in nature and not fully optimized
- For reproducible analyses, please refer to the vignettes in the main package
