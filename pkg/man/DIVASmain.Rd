\usage{
DIVASmain(
  datablock,
  nsim = 400,
  iprint = TRUE,
  colCent = FALSE,
  rowCent = FALSE,
  figdir = NULL,
  seed = NULL,
  ReturnDetail = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{datablock}{A list of matrices with the same number of columns (samples).}

\item{nsim}{Number of bootstrap resamples for inferring angle bounds.}

\item{iprint}{Whether to print diagnostic figures.}

\item{colCent}{Whether to column centre the input data blocks.}

\item{rowCent}{Whether to row centre the input data blocks.}

\item{figdir}{If not NULL, then diagnostic plots will be saved to this directory.}

\item{seed}{Optional. An integer to set the seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility of the bootstrap analysis. Default is `NULL`.}

\item{ReturnDetail}{Logical. If FALSE (default), return a compact result list focusing on the most user-relevant elements to save storage space. If TRUE, return the full detailed result structure.}
}
\value{
A list containing DIVAS integration results. Most important ones include
  \describe{
    \item{matBlocks}{List of scores representing shared and partially shared joint structures.}
    \item{matLoadings}{List of loadings linking features in each data block with scores.}
    \item{keyIdxMap}{Mapping between indices of the previous lists and data blocks.}
    \item{Scores}{A comprehensive matrix with samples as rows and all component scores as columns. Column names follow the pattern "X-Way-Y" for joint structures (e.g., "6-Way-1", "5-Way-2") and "BlockName-Individual-Y" for individual structures. (Renamed from sampleScoreMatrix for clarity)}
    \item{scoresList}{List of recalculated scores computed as X^T * Loadings for each data block, offering an alternative to the original scores. (Renamed from Scores for clarity)}
    \item{Loadings}{List of inverse loadings matrices for each data block. Each element is a features Ã— components matrix, where rows are features and columns are components (e.g., "RNA+PRO+MIC-1", "RNA-1", etc.). Provides better biological interpretability than original matLoadings.}
    \item{LoadingsNames}{A list of character vectors per data block, each listing available component names in Loadings[[block]].}
  }
  See Details for more explanations.

\description{
Main function for DIVAS analysis. Given a list of data blocks with matched columns (samples), will return identified joint
structure with diagnostic plots.
}
\details{
DIVASmain returns a list containing all important information returned from the DIVAS algorithm.
For users, the most important ones are scores (matBlocks), loadings (matLoadings) and an index
book (keyIdxMap) explaining what joint structures each score or loading matrix correpsond to.

matBlocks is a list containing scores. Each element of matBlocks is indexed by a number.
For example, suppose one of the indices is "7", then keyIdxMap[["7"]] contains indices of data blocks
corresponding to the index 7. That is, matBlocks[["7"]] contains the scores for all samples
representing the joint structures of data blocks in keyIdxMap[["7"]].
