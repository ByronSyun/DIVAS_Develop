\arguments{
\item{blockIn}{A logical vector indicating which blocks are included.}

\item{dataname}{A character vector of data matrix names.}

\item{VBars}{A list of matrices, each representing the adjusted signal row spaces.}

\item{phiBars}{A numeric vector of perturbation angles for each data matrix.}

\item{rBars}{A numeric vector of adjusted signal ranks for each data matrix.}

\item{curRanks}{A numeric vector indicating current ranks.}

\item{outMap}{A list mapping between joint block index set and estimated shared structure.}

\item{theta0}{A numeric value representing the base angle for perturbation. Default is 45 degrees.}

\item{optArgin}{A list of optional arguments for optimization.}

\item{iprint}{An integer for verbosity level. Default is 0.}

\item{figdir}{A character string indicating where to save output figures.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \item{Vi}{Matrix of joint structure vectors.}
  \item{curRanks}{Updated ranks after estimation.}
  \item{angles}{Matrix of angles estimated for each search direction.}
}
\description{
Estimates the joint structure shared among multiple data matrices (blocks).
This function finds joint structures by optimizing an objective function and
adjusting the search direction iteratively.
