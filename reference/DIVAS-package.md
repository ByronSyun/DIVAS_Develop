# DIVAS: Data Integration via Analysis of Subspaces

Based on 'Data integration via analysis of subspaces (DIVAS)' by
Prothero et al. (2024), this is a package that implements the DIVAS
methodology for multi-modal data integration. This package provides
tools for signal extraction, noise estimation and joint structure
identification from high-dimensional datasets, useful for multi-omics
and other complex data types.
